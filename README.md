### This project is built using Node.js, Docker and Redis to run code in multiple languages inside isolated containers and return results or errors.

### Future iterations include
- Creating a backend server âœ…
- Providing User input via online editors, storing code into temporary files that will be mounted to individual containers and run inside them
- Implementing user authentication and authorization
- Connecting to an external Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) for keeping records of every program execution done
- Load balancing and limiting the memory/space constraints of the docker containers spinning up on code inputs
